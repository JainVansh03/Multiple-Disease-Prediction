			<h3 style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">Eat a healthy diet:</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Eating a healthy diet is an essential part of preventing heart attacks.

These foods provide essential nutrients and fiber that help maintain a healthy weight and prevent heart disease. It is also important to limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium, which are found in many processed and fast foods. Instead, choose healthy fats such as those found in nuts, seeds, and fatty fish. Additionally, reducing the amount of added sugars in your diet can lower your risk of heart disease.
