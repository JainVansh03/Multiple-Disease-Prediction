			<h3 style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">Perform CPR:</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Performing CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) is a crucial step if the person is unconscious and not breathing during a heart attack. CPR involves performing chest compressions and rescue breaths to help keep blood flowing to the heart and brain until emergency medical help arrives. To perform CPR, start by placing the person on their back on a firm surface and kneeling beside them. Place the heel of one hand on the center of the person's chest and place the other hand on top of the first hand. Press down on the chest firmly and quickly, about 2 inches deep, at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute.

			<h3 style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">Stay calm and still:</h3>
<p style="color:white;">When a person has a chance of suffering from a heart attack, it's essential to stay calm and still while waiting for emergency medical help to arrive. Moving around can worsen the symptoms, so it's best to avoid any unnecessary activity. Sit or lie down in a comfortable position and try to remain calm. Taking slow, deep breaths can help to reduce anxiety and stress. If possible, loosen any tight clothing and remove anything that might be restricting breathing, such as a tie or necklace. Avoid eating or drinking anything, including medication, unless directed to do so by emergency medical personnel. </p>

			<h3 style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">Recognize the symptoms:</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Recognizing the symptoms of a heart attack is crucial if a person has a chance of suffering from one. Common symptoms include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, nausea, lightheadedness, and pain or discomfort in other areas of the upper body, such as the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach. If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, call for emergency medical help immediately.

			<h3 style="color:white; font-weight: bold;">Assist with medication:</h3>
<p style="color:white;">If a person has been prescribed nitroglycerin, it can be an effective way to relieve the symptoms of a heart attack. Nitroglycerin helps to relax and widen blood vessels, improving blood flow to the heart. If the person is experiencing symptoms of a heart attack and has been prescribed nitroglycerin, assist them in taking it as directed by their doctor. This may involve placing a tablet under the tongue or using a spray or patch. It's important to follow the prescribed dosage and wait the recommended amount of time between doses.

			<h3 style="color:white; font-weight: bold;"> Support lifestyle changes:</h3>
<p style="color:white;">Encouraging lifestyle changes can be an effective way to reduce the risk of a heart attack. Quitting smoking is one of the most important steps a person can take to reduce their risk. Smoking damages blood vessels and can lead to the buildup of plaque in arteries, increasing the risk of a heart attack.
